# zomb-apocolypse
> plz anybody who knows how to spell "apocolypse" comment it 

zomb-apocolypse is a top-down post-apocolyptic shooter. The world has been taken over by the Undead and they created zombies from all the people they zombified.

The few survivors created a Resistance movement to overthrow the Darkness, but the Darkness put forward a zombie spawner.

You are their defender from the zombies before the Resistance flies their Helicopters toward the Darkness' base.
